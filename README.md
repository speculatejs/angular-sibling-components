# angular-sibling-components

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-sibling-components)

Many examples exist which demonstrate data-sharing between child and parent components. This practice set introduces one way to pass data between components that share a parent (component siblings). The technique used here makes use of the @ViewChild decorator. (Other solutions to this problem make use of Angular services.)

Along the way, you will also:
  * Bind properties to DOM events and pass data to the bound function
  * Use the @Output decorator to pass information out of the component to its parent

Detailed instructions:

The example displays a menu of city names. When a name is clicked, details about the city are rendered in the content pane. A completed version can ve viewed here:

The exercise includes four "TODO" items:
  * Two are required in the HTML files 
  * Two are required in app.component.ts file. 
  
  Once the todos are completed correctly, this example will have the functionality seen in the solution above. Good luck!
